This is project for my faculty exam.
I had previous knowledge of Java and JSP, and a little bit of JavaScript and CSS.
This is my first time using Spring, Hibernate, jQuery, jqWidgets, Bootstrap, and many java libraries like Apachee's DBCP, FileUtils, or library for feed parsing ROME, and others.

Instructions how to setup application are in setup folder.
